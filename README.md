# EECS1710-Final_Project-Synaesthetic_Instrument

*Important: this project requires the instalation of processing's sound library*

This project simulates an audiovisual instrument. By pressing the space bar, a beat starts playing
and accompanying circles will randomly pop up on the screen. By pressing the up and down arrows, users
can increase and decrease the rate at which the beat is being played (and therefore, the speed of the
visuals will get slower and faster).
    
By pressing on the a,s,d,f and g buttons on the keyboard, users can simulate something similar to a piano with tiles
represented by rectangles that drop down when their respective button is pressed.
